## 🤖 AI Assistance

AI tools were used during development to get suggestions and guidance for:

- Designing a clean and accessible dark theme
- Selecting and defining reusable CSS `:root` color variables
- Creating responsive layouts using CSS Grid
- Improving overall layout structure, spacing, and visual hierarchy

The assistance was limited to design suggestions and layout ideas.
All implementation, customization, and integration were done manually.
